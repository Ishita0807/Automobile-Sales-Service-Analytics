## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Leverage Seasonal Demand Peaks**  
   Boost inventory and run targeted promotions leading up to **October and December**, when demand naturally spikes.

   The East region shows high sales potential. Consider opening new outlets or enhancing service quality there.

3. **Strengthen Brand Strategy Around Kia and Tata**  
   Kia and Tata are top performers. Focus marketing efforts on their newer models and after-sales services.

4. **Address Core Service Complaints**  
   Prioritize resolving **Transmission**, **Engine**, and **Brake** issues by retraining technicians and improving part availability.

5. **Improve Service Quality Beyond Speed**  
   Since customer satisfaction isn‚Äôt tied to speed alone, focus on better communication, transparency, and support.

6. **Replicate Elite Motors‚Äô Practices**  
   Use Elite Motors as a benchmark for training and operations. Intervene at **Metro Cars** with service quality audits and staff upskilling.
